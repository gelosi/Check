# The Check app for iOS

## Purpose

Simple checklist for todoing. As simple as possible. Or simpler. Superdumb.

## Development Plan

 - test idea of primitive list with checkmarks
 - add a real item editor (e.g. create item)
 - save list on every change? (currently, only on app close) 

## Future

- possible synchronization via icloud (or other service)
 -- might consider using some timestamps

## Design

- guess, rip off the best guys on the market might work (while keep away of overhelming features)
